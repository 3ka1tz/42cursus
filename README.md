# 42 Common Core

This repo contains an index of all the projects I've completed as part of the 42 common core curriculum. You can find me on the 42 intranet under the username [elopez-u](https://profile-v3.intra.42.fr/users/elopez-u).

Click on the project names or badges below to access each individual project repository.

Every project repo has everything needed to be completed. I added some images, so you can use them when documenting your own progress. All those images were downloaded from [github.com/ayogun/42-project-badges](https://github.com/ayogun/42-project-badges). Furthermore, I replicated all project subjects into their respective repository README.md files to preserve the information in case the originals are deleted.

## Disclaimer

These repositories contain my personal solutions to 42 School projects, each one following my own style, always trying to create a efficient and easy to understand code, but are not neccessary the 100% optimal way to do it.

The goal of making this public is to help others compare, learn and improve — not to encourage blind copying.

Please take the time to understand the concepts, write your own code and treat these solutions as a reference, not a shortcut.
